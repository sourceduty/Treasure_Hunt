To play **Treasure Hunt**, your objective is to find the buried treasure within 35 steps. You start the game 25 steps away from the treasure, but the exact direction is unknownâ€”it could be left, right, forwards, or backwards. 

### ChatGPT Version

Here's how you can play:

1. Choose Your Direction: On each turn, decide whether you want to move left, right, forwards, or backwards.

2. Make a Move: After choosing a direction, you take a step in that direction.

3. Receive Feedback: After each move, I'll tell you how far you are from the treasure and how many steps you have remaining out of the initial 35.

4. Adjust and Continue: Use the feedback to decide your next move. The goal is to reach the exact spot of the treasure within 35 steps.

The objective is to find the treasure in the least number of steps.
